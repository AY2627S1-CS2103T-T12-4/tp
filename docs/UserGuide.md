TAssist is a **desktop application for CS2040S teaching assistants, optimized for typing commands**.
This v1.2 increment introduces the TAssist interface while retaining the existing contact commands.
Tutorial groups, student IDs, attendance, participation, and assignments are **coming soon**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure that Java `25` is installed on your computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from the [team releases page](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/releases), when available.
   If no release is available yet, build the project with `./gradlew shadowJar` and use `build/libs/addressbook.jar`.

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for TAssist.

1. Open a terminal, `cd` to the folder containing the JAR file, and run `java -jar addressbook.jar`.<br>
   A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

1. Type a command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. For example, type **`help`** and press Enter to open the command reference.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Using the workspace

The top row opens **Students**, **Groups**, **Attendance**, **Participation**, **Assignments**, **Help**, and **Storage**.
Use the `view` command to open the same screens by typing. The command box and feedback remain visible on every screen.
Press **Escape** to return focus to the command box, or **F1** to open Help.

* **Students** displays live contact records. The row numbers match the indices used by `edit` and `delete`.
  `find` filters the roster; `list` restores all contacts. Changing screens preserves the filter.
  Scroll the table horizontally to see all fields and vertically to see more contacts. Hover over a shortened value
  to read its full text. Sorting is disabled to preserve command indices.
* **Groups**, **Attendance**, **Participation**, and **Assignments** show the planned layouts with a **Coming soon**
  label. They contain no simulated records. Week controls are unavailable, and their domain commands are not yet
  supported. Existing tags are not tutorial groups; phone numbers are not student IDs.
* **Help** provides an offline reference for currently supported commands.
* **Storage** shows the configured local JSON file and explains automatic saving.

Feedback turns red when a command fails. The failed input stays in the command box so you can correct it.
Long feedback and screen contents can be scrolled. Smaller windows use a compact layout.
The footer shows the local file path and reports successful saves or command failures.
Opening a screen with `view` does not save or change data.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  For example, in `add n/NAME`, replace `NAME` with a value such as `John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  For example, `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items followed by `…`​ can appear zero or more times.<br>
  For example, `[t/TAG]…​` may be omitted, or written as `t/friend` or `t/friend t/family`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  For example, if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that take no parameters, such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`, are ignored.<br>
  For example, `help 123` is interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

### Viewing help: `help`

Opens the offline command reference in the Help screen.

Format: `help`


### Opening a screen: `view`

Format: `view SCREEN`

`SCREEN` is one of `students`, `groups`, `attendance`, `participation`, `assignments`, `help`, or `storage`.
Screen names ignore case. Specify exactly one screen name. This command preserves the current roster filter.
An unknown screen name reports `Unknown screen` and lists the valid names. Missing or multiple screen names report
an invalid command format and show the expected syntax.

Examples: `view students`, `view attendance`, `view storage`.

### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A person can have any number of tags, including zero.
</div>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`

### Listing all persons: `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the address book.

Format: `list`

### Editing a person: `edit`

Edits an existing person in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, all of the person's existing tags are removed; adding tags is not cumulative.
* To remove all of a person's tags, enter `t/` without a tag after it.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive; for example, `hans` matches `Hans`.
* Keyword order does not matter; for example, `Hans Bo` matches `Bo Hans`.
* The search considers only names.
* Only full words match; for example, `Han` does not match `Hans`.
* Persons matching at least one keyword are returned (an `OR` search); for example, `Hans Bo` returns `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang`.

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'find alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)

### Deleting a person: `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the address book.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program: `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

TAssist saves contact data after successful commands, except `view`, which only changes the visible screen.
You do not need to save manually. A failed command does not indicate a successful save; read the feedback.

### Editing the data file

Contact data is saved as `data/addressbook.json` relative to the folder from which you launch TAssist.
The Storage screen shows the absolute path. Close the app before editing this JSON file manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes make the data file invalid, AddressBook starts with an empty address book at the next run. The invalid file remains on disk until a successful command other than `view` saves the contact data. Still, we recommend backing up the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the data file it creates with the data file from your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
